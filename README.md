# CISSP_Mindmap
CISSP interactive Mindmap that I made using the information I received from several sources while studying for the CISSP exam to assist readers understand certain key concepts. In my experience, the most difficult part of studying for an exam is figuring out all the different kinds of information we need to know and where to find it. As part of my study for the CISSP exam, I have compiled this mindmap and the reference materials I used, which I gleaned from a wide range of trainings, books, and self-training videos.
